"""
Print (and optionally pin) the certificate an APK is signed with.

This exists because a signing mistake is invisible until someone tries to
install the result. Android refuses to install an APK over one signed with a
different key, so a release built with the wrong key looks completely fine —
it installs on a clean phone, passes every test, and only fails for the people
who already have the app, at which point the only fix is uninstalling and
losing their settings.

That is what happened here: the release build was signed with the DEBUG key,
which is generated per machine, so every CI runner produced a different
certificate. Three consecutive published releases had three different ones.

Modern APKs carry no META-INF certificate — signing schemes v2 and v3 live in
the APK Signing Block between the file entries and the central directory — so
this parses that block rather than looking in the zip.

Usage:
    python3 tools/apk-cert.py app.apk
    python3 tools/apk-cert.py app.apk --expect <sha256>
    python3 tools/apk-cert.py app.apk --expect-file tools/release-key.sha256
