/**
 * A small HTTP/1.1 server. Ported from MusicD Remote Lite.
 *
 * This is what serves the card — to the app's own WebView over loopback, and to
 * a browser on any other device in the house over the LAN. One page, one
 * socket, and a phone across the room gets byte-identical bytes to the FiiO the
 * APK is installed on. That is the whole "open it in a browser" feature.
 *
 * THIS SERVER ANSWERS THE NETWORK BY DEFAULT, AND THAT IS A DECISION. In the
 * app this came from, loopback was the safe state and LAN access was a switch
 * behind a PIN — because there were eighty `/api/` routes back there that
 * control somebody's music system, and a settings store holding their API keys.
 *
 * There is no such surface here. Every route in [com.musicd.sharecard.api] is a
 * GET, nothing mutates a player, nothing is stored, and the most an uninvited
 * guest on the LAN can learn is which record is on. The exposure is the whole
 * point of the app rather than a compromise of it, so the gate that was
 * necessary there would be a lock on a picture frame here.
 *
 * What that DOES mean: do not add a route to this app that writes anything —
 * to a player, to disk, or to a setting — without putting an authentication
 * gate in front of the socket in the same change.
