/**
 * The two services this extension PROVIDES to the Core, rather than consumes.
 *
 * Every other Roon call in this app goes one way: we ask, the Core answers. A
 * provided service is the other direction — the Core makes requests of US, and
 * an extension that advertises one and then does not answer it is worse than
 * one that never advertised it. Ping was the only one, and it is answered in
 * [MooSocket] because dropping it gets the extension disconnected.
 *
 * These two are why the app appeared in Roon → Settings → Extensions as a bare
 * name with nothing beside it:
 *
 *   - **status** is the line of text under the extension's name. It is the only
 *     place the phone can say "I am connected, and here is what to" on a screen
 *     that is NOT the phone — which is exactly the screen you are looking at
 *     when the phone is the thing that has stopped working.
 *   - **settings** is the panel behind the gear. Roon renders it from a layout
 *     we send; there is no HTML and no callback into our UI.
 *
 * ALL OF IT IS SOCKET-FREE ON PURPOSE. A request comes in as three strings and
 * a body, and an [Outcome] goes back — so every reply shape in here is asserted
 * in a plain JVM test rather than by watching Roon's UI and guessing. The
 * shapes themselves are taken from RoonLabs' own node-roon-api-status and
 * node-roon-api-settings, not from documentation.
