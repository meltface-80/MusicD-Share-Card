/**
 * The Qobuz album id for the record on the card, so the link can open the Qobuz
 * APP on the record instead of a browser on a shop page.
 *
 * Ported from MusicD Remote Lite. [StreamingLinks] alone was ported first, and
 * that shipped the search link on its own — which lands on the Qobuz download
 * store's search page and never opens the app. This is the half that makes it
 * open the app, and it is why the app this came from "almost always" does.
 *
 * WHY AN ID IS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS. open.qobuz.com is Qobuz's own "open
 * this in the app" host — its page is titled "Open Qobuz" — and both platforms
 * hand it every path, because Qobuz publishes an assetlinks.json and an
 * apple-app-site-association claiming all of them. Its router understands
 * exactly five shapes, and they are all ids:
 *
 *     /album/:id   /artist/:id   /track/:id   /playlist/:id   /:type/:id
 *
 * There is no search route, on that host or in the app behind it, which is why
 * an open.qobuz.com/search?q= link opens the app on Discover with the query
 * thrown away, and why no search URL anywhere will ever do better. Sending the
 * link to the web player instead does not help: play.qobuz.com is claimed by
 * the same app, so the app takes that link too and lands in the same place.
 *
 * WHERE THE ID COMES FROM. Qobuz's own public search page, read the way
 * [Pitchfork] reads pitchfork.com: no API, no key, no account, nothing but the
 * markup a browser is served. Their API is a different matter — it wants
 * credentials this project does not have and may not borrow — and this deals
 * only with a page anyone can open.
 *
 * A WRONG ALBUM IS WORSE THAN A SEARCH PAGE. Qobuz answers a query it cannot
 * place with its nearest guess rather than nothing, so the first hit is never
 * taken on trust: the slug it is filed under has to match the record that was
 * asked for, or this returns null and the page keeps the search link.

     * so "album then artist" is the signal. It is compared on letters and
     * digits alone, because Qobuz's slugging is not a rule that can be
     * reproduced: an apostrophe and a full stop vanish ("Ol' Dirty Bastard" is
     * ol-dirty-bastard, "good kid, m.A.A.d city" is good-kid-maad-city) while a
     * slash becomes a separator ("AC/DC" is ac-dc). Dropping every separator
     * from both sides makes all three agree, and [Normalize.text] is the app's
     * one folding rule, so accents fold the same way here as everywhere else.
     *
     * An exact "album+artist" is taken wherever it appears in the results, not
     * merely first: searching "Mezzanine" returns the remixes album too, and it
     * often sorts above the record. Failing that, a result that STARTS with the
     * album and mentions the artist will do — that catches a remaster or a
     * deluxe edition, whose slug carries a suffix the speaker's title does not.
     *
     * Anything else is a guess, and a guess here opens the wrong record.
